✨ With this setup:
- **`.gitignore`** keeps your repo clean.  
- **`LICENSE`** makes your repo open-source.  
- **`README`** gives it a professional first impression.  

Do you want me to also suggest a **repo structure** (like `articles/`, `images/`, etc.) so it stays organized as you add more topics?
